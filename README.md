# Graph Coloring Project

## This repo is kind mess, the code has segmentation fault on some edge case, I passed the course. Maybe in a future i will fix the bug.

This project is focused on counting the possible colorings of a graph. Graph coloring is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is a common problem in combinatorial optimization and has applications in various fields such as scheduling, register allocation in compilers, and network coloring.
